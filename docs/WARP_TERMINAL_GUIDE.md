## Introduction

Welcome, security professionals! This guide will help you set up and use **Docker MCP Gateway** with **Warp Terminal's AI** to conduct authorized security assessments using the Kali MCP Server.

**No programming experience required!** This guide uses a modern approach where:
- One gateway manages all your security tool servers
- Warp AI helps you understand every command and tool output
- You can add multiple tool sets (not just Kali!)
- Everything runs in secure Docker containers with enforced safety controls

### What You'll Learn

1. How to set up the Docker MCP Gateway (the "master controller")
2. How to add the Kali MCP Server with 42 professional security tools
3. How to connect Warp Terminal for AI-assisted security testing
4. How to use Warp AI to conduct safe, authorized assessments
5. How to add other security toolsets to the same gateway

### Who This Guide Is For

- **Network and security engineers** conducting authorized assessments
- **Security professionals** new to AI-assisted testing
- **Penetration testers** looking for safer, faster workflows
- **Anyone** with proper authorization to test systems

You do NOT need to be a programmer or developer. This guide explains everything in plain language.

## What is the Docker MCP Gateway?

Think of the Docker MCP Gateway as a **master security control center** that safely manages all your security testing tools.

### Simple Analogy

Imagine you have multiple specialized security toolkits:
- One for network reconnaissance (Kali MCP Server)
- One for your firewall (OPNsense)
- One for your virtualization servers (Proxmox)
- One for other security tools

The Docker MCP Gateway is like a **secure command center** that:
- Manages all these toolkits in one place
- Lets Warp AI talk to all of them through one safe connection
- Enforces strict security controls on every tool
- Makes it easy to add or remove toolkits
- Keeps everything organized and traceable

### Without Gateway (Old Way)

```
Warp Terminal ‚Üí Direct connection to Kali Tools
                (Have to configure each toolkit separately)
                (Harder to enforce security controls)
```

### With Gateway (New Way - What You'll Use)

```
Warp Terminal (AI Assistant)
    ‚Üì (One secure connection)
Docker MCP Gateway (Security Control Center)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Kali MCP Server (42 security testing tools)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí OPNsense MCP Server (firewall management) 
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Proxmox MCP Server (VM management)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Other Security Tools
         ‚Üì
    Authorized Target Systems
    (WITH WRITTEN PERMISSION ONLY)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ One Warp configuration for everything
- ‚úÖ Centralized security controls
- ‚úÖ Easy to add new security toolkits
- ‚úÖ All tools available in one AI conversation
- ‚úÖ Enforced safety restrictions (no raw sockets, non-root, limited privileges)

## What is Warp AI?

Warp is a modern terminal with a built-in AI assistant. It's like having an experienced security engineer available 24/7 to:

- **Explain commands** before you run them
- **Help troubleshoot** when scans fail or behave unexpectedly
- **Generate safe commands** for security testing tasks
- **Interpret tool output** - explain what nmap, nikto, or sqlmap results mean
- **Provide guidance** for unfamiliar tools or techniques
- **Validate scope** - help you confirm you're testing authorized targets

### Key Warp Features for Security Engineers

1. **AI Command Help** (`Ctrl+Shift+Space`): Ask AI about anything
2. **Command Explanations**: Highlight any command and ask "What does this do?"
3. **Error Diagnosis**: When a scan fails, AI explains why
4. **Output Interpretation**: AI explains complex security tool output
5. **Command History**: Searchable history with `Ctrl+R`
6. **Workflows**: Save common security testing sequences

### Why This Matters for Security Testing

- **Safer**: AI can help you validate commands before execution
- **Faster**: Quick answers without searching documentation
- **Better Results**: AI helps interpret findings and suggest next steps
- **Learning**: Continuously learn as AI explains tools and techniques
- **Compliance**: AI can help verify you're following proper procedures

---

## Why Use This Setup?

### For Security Engineers Who Aren't Programmers

1. **AI Guidance**: Warp AI helps with Docker commands and tool syntax
2. **Simplified Management**: One gateway manages all security tools
3. **Safety Controls**: Docker enforces security restrictions automatically
4. **Easy Troubleshooting**: Warp AI diagnoses Docker and tool issues
5. **Scalable**: Start with Kali tools, add firewalls and other tools later

### Real-World Example

**Scenario**: You need to assess a web application's security posture.

**Without Gateway and Warp AI**: 
- Open multiple terminals for different tools
- Remember exact command syntax for nmap, nikto, sqlmap
- Interpret cryptic error messages alone
- Manually correlate findings across tools

**With Gateway and Warp AI**:
- Open one Warp terminal
- Ask: "Scan testapp.local for web vulnerabilities - check ports, run nikto, and test for SQL injection"
- AI coordinates tools, explains results, suggests next steps
- All findings in one conversation with context

### ARM64 (Apple Silicon) Optimization

This setup is optimized for Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3):

‚úÖ **Fully Compatible**: All 42 tools work on ARM64
‚ö†Ô∏è **hashcat**: CPU-only mode (no GPU acceleration on ARM64)
‚úÖ **Performance**: Excellent for most security testing tasks

### Docker Security Model

The Docker MCP Gateway enforces strict security controls:

**Security Restrictions:**
- **No raw sockets**: Cannot perform low-level network operations
- **Non-root execution**: Tools run as unprivileged user
- **No new privileges**: Cannot escalate permissions inside container
- **Isolated network**: Container has controlled network access

**Practical Implications:**
- ‚úÖ nmap works with `-sT` (TCP connect) and `-Pn` (skip ping) flags
- ‚úÖ Most security tools work without modification
- ‚ùå No ICMP ping scans (but TCP works fine)
- ‚ùå No ARP scanning (not needed for most assessments)
- ‚ùå No raw packet operations (use application-layer protocols instead)

These restrictions **enhance security** while still providing 42 professional tools for authorized testing.

       (ONLY WITH WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION)
```

### Key Components

1. **Warp Terminal**: Where you type commands and ask AI for help
2. **Docker MCP Gateway**: The master control center that manages everything
3. **Kali MCP Server**: Container with 42 security testing tools
4. **Catalog Files**: YAML files that define available security tool servers
5. **Target Systems**: ONLY systems you have written authorization to test

### Configuration Files Explained

Your Docker MCP Gateway uses several configuration files:

```
~/.docker/mcp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ catalogs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-mcp.yaml      # Official servers (GitHub, AWS, etc.)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom.yaml           # YOUR custom servers (Kali, OPNsense, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml               # Server-specific configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ registry.yaml             # List of all registered servers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools.yaml                # Tool-specific settings (usually empty)
```

**You'll mainly work with `custom.yaml`** to add your Kali MCP server!

**Simple Explanation:**
- `custom.yaml` is like your **phonebook** of security tool servers
- `registry.yaml` is like your **favorites list** of which servers to use
- `config.yaml` stores **specific settings** for each server

---

## Quick Setup Guide

Let's get everything set up step-by-step. Warp AI will help you at each stage.

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

1. Download Docker Desktop from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Install and open Docker Desktop
3. Wait for Docker to start (you'll see a green "Running" status)
4. Accept the Docker Desktop service agreement if prompted

**Verify Docker is running:**

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see something like: `Docker version 24.0.x, build ...`

**Ask Warp AI if you get an error:**
```
"I got this error when checking Docker version: [paste error]. How do I fix it?"
```

### Step 2: Enable MCP in Docker Desktop

1. Open **Docker Desktop**
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Navigate to **Features** (may be under Extensions or Advanced depending on version)
4. Find **"MCP"** or **"Model Context Protocol"** or **"MCP Gateway"**
5. Toggle to **Enabled**
6. Click **Apply & Restart**

**Note**: The exact location varies by Docker Desktop version. Look for "MCP" in settings.

**Ask Warp AI if you can't find it:**
```
"Where is the MCP setting in Docker Desktop version [your version]?"
```

### Step 3: Create the MCP Directory Structure

This creates all the folders you need:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.docker/mcp/catalogs
```

**Verify it was created:**

```bash
ls -la ~/.docker/mcp/
```

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"What does the mkdir -p command do?"
```

### Step 4: Create Empty Configuration Files

Let's create the configuration files that the gateway needs:

```bash
# Create empty config files
touch ~/.docker/mcp/config.yaml
touch ~/.docker/mcp/registry.yaml
touch ~/.docker/mcp/tools.yaml
```

**Explanation**: These files will be used by the Docker MCP Gateway. We'll add content to them in the next steps.

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Explain what these YAML files are for in the Docker MCP Gateway"
```

**Congratulations!** The basic setup is complete. Next, we'll add the Kali MCP Server.

---

## Adding the Kali MCP Server

Now let's add the Kali MCP Server with its 42 security tools to your gateway.

### Step 1: Build the Kali MCP Server Docker Image

First, get the Kali MCP server code (if you haven't already):

```bash
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kali-mcp-server.git
cd kali-mcp-server
```

**Build the Docker image:**

```bash
docker build -t kali-mcp-server:latest .
```

‚è±Ô∏è **Build time**: 15-30 minutes (downloads Kali tools and packages)

**Ask Warp AI while building:**
```
"Explain what 'docker build' is doing while it runs"
```

**Verify the build completed:**

```bash
docker images | grep kali-mcp-server
```

You should see: `kali-mcp-server   latest   [image-id]   [time]   ~3.2GB`

### Step 2: Add to Your Custom Catalog

Create/edit your custom catalog file:

```bash
nano ~/.docker/mcp/catalogs/custom.yaml
```

**Add this content:**

```yaml
version: 2
name: custom
displayName: Custom Security Servers
registry:
  kali-mcp-server:
    description: "Kali Linux penetration testing MCP server with 42 professional security tools. Provides network reconnaissance (nmap variants, DNS enumeration, subdomain discovery), web application testing (nikto, sqlmap, WordPress scanning, fuzzing), SSL/TLS testing, SMB/Windows enumeration, password testing, vulnerability research (searchsploit, Metasploit), OSINT, and combined operations. ARM64 optimized for Apple Silicon. Runs with security restrictions: no raw sockets, non-root user, no new privileges."

## Using Warp AI Features

Now that everything is connected, let's learn how to use Warp AI effectively for security testing.

### Feature 1: Command Explanations

**Scenario**: You see a Docker command but don't understand it.

**How to use:**
1. Highlight the command text in Warp
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Space` or click the AI sparkle icon
3. Type: "Explain this command"

**Example:**

```bash
docker run -i --rm --security-opt no-new-privileges kali-mcp-server:latest
```

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Explain what each part of this Docker command does and why we use these flags"
```

Warp AI will explain:
- `-i`: Interactive mode for stdin communication
- `--rm`: Removes container after it exits (cleanup)
- `--security-opt no-new-privileges`: Security hardening
- Purpose of each flag for the MCP Gateway

### Feature 2: Error Diagnosis

**Scenario**: A security tool fails with an error.

**Example error:**

```
Error: nmap: Operation not permitted
```

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"I got 'Operation not permitted' when running nmap through kali-mcp-server. Why did this happen and how should nmap be configured for Docker MCP Gateway?"
```

Warp AI will explain:
- This is expected - Docker MCP Gateway restricts raw sockets
- nmap uses `-Pn` flag automatically to work without ICMP ping
- This is a security feature, not a problem
- TCP connect scans (`-sT`) work fine

### Feature 3: Generating Safe Commands

**Scenario**: You want to perform a security task but don't know exact syntax.

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"I need to scan a test web application at testapp.local for common vulnerabilities. What's the safe way to do this using kali-mcp-server tools?"
```

Warp AI will suggest:
- Start with nmap to find open web ports
- Run nikto for web server scanning
- Consider nuclei for template-based vuln scanning
- Remind you to confirm authorization first

### Feature 4: Interpreting Tool Output

**Scenario**: You run a security tool and get complex output.

**Example**: You ask:
```
"Scan testapp.local with nikto"
```

And get output like:
```
+ Server: Apache/2.4.41
+ The anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present.
+ The X-XSS-Protection header is not defined.
+ Cookie PHPSESSID created without the httponly flag
...
```

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Explain this nikto output in simple terms. Which findings are most critical and what do they mean?"
```

Warp AI will:
- Explain each vulnerability
- Rank findings by severity
- Suggest remediation steps
- Note what's informational vs. exploitable

### Feature 5: Authorization and Scope Validation

**Before running any security test**, always validate with Warp AI:

```
"I'm about to scan the network range 192.168.1.0/24 with nmap. What should I verify before running this? What are the legal and ethical considerations?"
```

Warp AI will remind you to:
- Verify written authorization
- Confirm targets are in-scope
- Check if testing window is active
- Ensure proper change control (if production)
- Document the activity

**Critical**: AI can guide you, but YOU are responsible for authorization compliance.

## Common Security Operations

Here are practical workflows for conducting authorized security assessments using Kali MCP Server's 42 tools.

**‚ö†Ô∏è AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED FOR ALL OPERATIONS BELOW**

### Workflow 1: Network Discovery

**Goal**: Identify active hosts and open ports on authorized networks.

**Tools**: `nmap_scan`, `nmap_port_scan`, `nmap_service_scan`, `nmap_comprehensive_scan`, `nmap_script_scan`, `nmap_vuln_scan`

**Ask Warp AI for guidance:**

```
"I have authorization to scan the network 192.168.1.0/24. What's a safe scanning approach that won't disrupt services?"
```

**Example Commands:**

**Quick port scan:**
```
"Use nmap_scan to scan 192.168.1.100 for common ports"
```

**Service identification:**
```

## Managing Multiple MCP Servers

One of the biggest advantages of the Docker MCP Gateway is managing multiple security tool servers. Here's how to add more tools beyond Kali.

### Understanding Multi-Server Setup

Your `custom.yaml` can contain multiple security tool servers:

```yaml
version: 2
name: custom
displayName: Custom Security Servers
registry:
  kali-mcp-server:
    # Kali configuration here (42 security tools)
  
  opnsense-mcp:
    # Firewall management here
  
  proxmox-mcp:
    # VM management here
```

### Example: Adding a Second Server

Let's say you want to add OPNsense firewall management.

**Step 1 - Build or pull the OPNsense MCP server:**

```bash
# Example - adjust based on actual server
docker pull opnsense-mcp-server:latest
```

**Step 2 - Add to custom.yaml:**

```bash
nano ~/.docker/mcp/catalogs/custom.yaml
```

Add under `registry:` (after your kali-mcp-server section):

```yaml
  opnsense-mcp:
    description: "OPNsense firewall management server"
    title: "OPNsense Firewall Manager"
    type: server
    dateAdded: "2025-01-16T00:00:00Z"
    image: opnsense-mcp-server:latest
    tools:
      - name: list_firewall_rules
      - name: get_system_status
    metadata:
      category: security
      tags:
        - firewall
        - opnsense
      license: MIT
      owner: local
```

**Step 3 - Add to registry:**

```bash
nano ~/.docker/mcp/registry.yaml
```

Add:

```yaml
  opnsense-mcp:
    ref: ""
```

**Step 4 - Restart Docker Desktop**

Your new server will be available!

### Using Multiple Servers Together

**Example conversation with Warp AI:**

```
"Check the security status of my authorized network: first scan with kali-mcp-server nmap, then review firewall rules with opnsense-mcp"
```

Warp AI will:
1. Connect to kali-mcp-server to run nmap
2. Connect to opnsense-mcp to check firewall rules
3. Correlate the information and present unified findings

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"What other MCP servers would complement the Kali security tools for a complete security assessment workflow?"
```

## Troubleshooting with Warp AI

When things go wrong, Warp AI is your troubleshooting partner. Here are common issues and how to diagnose them with AI assistance.

### Problem 1: Docker MCP Gateway Won't Start

**Symptom:**

```
Error: Cannot connect to MCP gateway
```

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Docker MCP Gateway won't start. How do I troubleshoot this?"
```

**Step 1 - Check if Docker is running:**

```bash
docker ps
```

**Step 2 - Check Docker Desktop status:**
- Open Docker Desktop
- Look for green "Running" indicator
- Check for error messages

**Step 3 - Restart Docker Desktop:**
- Quit Docker Desktop completely
- Wait 10 seconds
- Restart

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Docker Desktop says it's running but Docker MCP Gateway still won't start. What should I check next?"
```

### Problem 2: Kali MCP Server Not Showing Up

**Symptom**: You added the server but Warp doesn't see it.

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"I added kali-mcp-server to custom.yaml but it's not showing up in Warp. How do I debug this?"
```

**Step 1 - Verify the configuration file:**

```bash
cat ~/.docker/mcp/catalogs/custom.yaml
```

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Can you check if this YAML syntax is correct? [paste your custom.yaml content]"
```

**Step 2 - Check if the image exists:**

```bash
docker images | grep kali-mcp-server
```

**Step 3 - Verify registry.yaml:**

```bash
cat ~/.docker/mcp/registry.yaml
```

**Step 4 - Restart everything:**
1. Quit Warp Terminal
2. Restart Docker Desktop
3. Wait for full initialization
4. Reopen Warp Terminal

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Still not showing up. What Docker logs should I check?"
```

### Problem 3: Can't Connect to Target

**Symptom:**

```
Error: Connection timed out
Error: No route to host
```

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"My Kali MCP scan can't connect to the target 192.168.1.100 with 'Connection timed out'. What should I check?"
```

**Warp AI will guide you through:**

1. **Test basic connectivity:**
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.100
   ```

2. **Check if target allows connections:**
   ```bash
   telnet 192.168.1.100 80
   ```

3. **Verify you're on the correct network:**
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep inet
   ```

4. **Confirm target is in authorized scope**

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Ping works but nmap scan times out. What might be blocking the connection?"
```

### Problem 4: Permission Denied Errors

**Symptom:**

```
Error: Operation not permitted
nmap: sendto: Operation not permitted
```

**This is EXPECTED behavior** - Docker MCP Gateway restricts raw sockets for security.

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"I'm getting 'Operation not permitted' with nmap. Is this normal for Docker MCP Gateway?"
```

**Warp AI will explain:**
- ‚úÖ **Normal**: Docker MCP Gateway blocks raw socket operations (ICMP ping, ARP, SYN scans)
- ‚úÖ **Expected**: nmap automatically uses `-Pn` (skip ping) and `-sT` (TCP connect) 
- ‚úÖ **Works fine**: TCP connect scans work without raw sockets
- ‚úÖ **Security feature**: This restriction enhances container security

**The tools are working correctly** - this is not an error!

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Explain why Docker MCP Gateway blocks raw sockets and how this affects security scanning"
```

### Problem 5: Docker Out of Space

**Symptom:**

```
Error: No space left on device
```

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Docker says 'no space left on device'. How do I clean up Docker images and containers?"
```

**Warp AI will suggest:**

```bash
# See disk usage
docker system df

# Clean up unused containers, networks, and images
docker system prune -a
```

**Follow-up:**
```
"I cleaned up but still seeing space issues. What else can I check?"
```

### Problem 6: Warp Can't See MCP Servers

**Symptom**: Warp AI doesn't recognize your MCP servers.

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Warp AI doesn't show any MCP servers. How do I verify MCP is configured correctly?"
```

**Step 1 - Verify MCP is enabled in Warp:**

1. Open Warp Settings (`Cmd+,`)
2. Go to **Features** or **AI**
3. Check **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is enabled

**Step 2 - Check Docker MCP provider:**

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"How do I verify Docker Desktop MCP provider is configured in Warp?"
```

**Step 3 - Restart Warp completely:**

- Quit Warp (`Cmd+Q`)
- Wait 5 seconds
- Open Warp again

**Step 4 - Test connection:**

```
"List all available MCP servers"
```

### Problem 7: Slow Performance / Scans Take Forever

**Symptom**: Security scans are very slow or timing out.

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"My nmap scan is taking forever on 192.168.1.100. How can I speed this up without compromising results?"
```

**Common causes and solutions:**

1. **Too many ports:**
   ```
   "Instead of scanning all 65535 ports, scan just common ports: run nmap_scan with ports 1-1000"
   ```

2. **Network latency:**
   ```
   "The target network is slow. What nmap timing options can I use for slow networks?"
   ```

3. **Large wordlists:**
   ```
   "My gobuster scan with big wordlist is too slow. Suggest a faster wordlist for initial reconnaissance"
   ```

4. **Resource limits:**
   **Ask Warp AI:**
   ```
   "How do I check if Docker resource limits are slowing down my Kali MCP scans?"
   ```

**ARM64-specific note:**
- Most tools perform well on Apple Silicon
- `hashcat_crack` uses CPU-only mode (slower than GPU)
- This is expected and normal

### Problem 8: hashcat "No devices found" Error

**Symptom:**

```
Error: No devices found/left
hashcat: Device #1: Not a native Intel OpenCL runtime
```

**This is EXPECTED on ARM64 (Apple Silicon)** - not an error!

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"hashcat says 'no devices found' on my M1 Mac. Is this an error?"
```

**Warp AI will explain:**
- ‚úÖ **Normal**: hashcat runs in CPU-only mode on ARM64 Macs
- ‚úÖ **Expected**: No GPU acceleration available on Apple Silicon
- ‚úÖ **Works**: CPU-mode still cracks passwords, just slower
- ‚úÖ **Automatic**: The `--force` flag is already added

**This is normal behavior** - hashcat is working correctly in CPU mode!

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Compare hashcat CPU performance on ARM64 vs alternatives like john for password cracking"
```

## Best Practices and Security

### Legal and Authorization Best Practices

**MOST IMPORTANT - Always Get Authorization:**

1. **Written Permission Required:**
   - Get explicit written authorization before any security testing
   - Include specific targets, dates, tools, and scope
   - Keep authorization documents secure and accessible

2. **Document Everything:**
   - Testing dates and times
   - Tools and commands used
   - Findings discovered
   - Actions taken

3. **Communicate During Testing:**
   - Notify system owners before testing begins
   - Have emergency contact information
   - Report critical findings immediately
   - Coordinate testing windows

4. **Respect Scope Limits:**
   - ONLY test authorized targets
   - Stay within documented IP ranges/domains
   - Do not exceed authorized tool lists
   - Stop if you discover unexpected scope

5. **Review AI Commands:**
   - ‚ùå NEVER blindly execute AI-generated commands
   - ‚úÖ ALWAYS review what the command will do
   - ‚úÖ Verify targets are authorized
   - ‚úÖ Ask AI to explain anything unclear

**Ask Warp AI before testing:**
```
"Before I begin testing, help me verify I have proper authorization. What should I check?"
```

### Docker MCP Gateway Best Practices

#### 1. Organize Your Catalog Files

Keep your servers organized in `custom.yaml`:

```yaml
# Group by function
registry:
  # Security Testing Tools
  kali-mcp-server:
    # config
  
  # Firewall Management
  opnsense-mcp:
    # config
  
  # Infrastructure Management
  proxmox-mcp:
    # config
```

#### 2. Use Descriptive Server Names

**Good names:**
- `kali-mcp-server`
- `opnsense-firewall`
- `production-proxmox`

**Bad names:**
- `server1`
- `mcp`
- `test`

#### 3. Document Your Setup

Create a README in your network documentation:

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"Create a template README to document my MCP security testing setup"
```

#### 4. Keep Docker Images Updated

Regularly update your security tool images:

```bash
# Pull latest base images
docker pull kalilinux/kali-rolling:arm64

# Rebuild your images
cd ~/Documents/kali-mcp-server
docker build -t kali-mcp-server:latest .

# Remove old images
docker image prune
```

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"How often should I rebuild my Kali MCP server image to get security updates?"
```

#### 5. Monitor Docker Resource Usage

**Check regularly:**

```bash
docker system df
```

**Clean up when needed:**

```bash
docker system prune -a
```

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"My Docker is using a lot of disk space. What can I safely delete?"
```

### Security Testing Best Practices

#### 1. Start with Least Invasive Tests

**Progressive testing approach:**
1. OSINT and passive reconnaissance first (whois, DNS)
2. Then active scanning (nmap, subdomain discovery)
3. Then service probing (nikto, nuclei)
4. Finally, exploit testing (sqlmap, metasploit) - ONLY if authorized

#### 2. Use Appropriate Scan Intensities

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"What's the difference between quick_recon and full_recon? Which should I use for initial assessment?"
```

**Guidance:**
- `quick_recon` - Fast, non-intrusive, good for initial assessment
- `nmap -F` - Scan top 100 ports (fast)
- `full_recon` - Comprehensive, takes time, authorized maintenance windows
- `nuclei` with specific templates - Targeted, efficient

#### 3. Rate Limit Your Scans

**Ask Warp AI:**
```
"How can I slow down my nmap scan to avoid overwhelming the target?"
```

#### 4. Test During Approved Windows

- Schedule intrusive tests during maintenance windows
- Notify stakeholders before testing
- Have rollback plans if issues occur
- Test non-production first when possible

#### 5. Backup Before Testing

**Before making changes or testing:**

```
"Document the current state of authorized-target.com before security testing"
```

```
"Teach me one advanced security testing technique I should know"

"Explain a Docker security concept"

"What's a useful feature of Kali MCP server I might not know about?"

"Describe a real-world penetration testing scenario and how to approach it"
```

#### Tip 4: Build Your Troubleshooting Playbook

Create `~/security-troubleshooting-playbook.md`:

```markdown
# Security Testing Troubleshooting Playbook

## Scan Not Connecting to Target
1. Verify authorization is current
2. Check network connectivity: `ping [target]`
3. Verify target in scope: Review authorization document
4. Test from different network if allowed
5. Ask Warp AI: "Target unreachable - what should I check?"

## Tool Returns No Results
1. Verify target is correct
2. Check if service is actually running
3. Try alternative tool
4. Ask Warp AI: "Tool returned empty results - why might this happen?"

## Permission Denied Errors
1. Check if it's Docker security restriction (expected)
2. Verify Docker MCP Gateway security-opt flags
3. Ask Warp AI: "Is this permission error expected for Docker MCP Gateway?"

## Slow Performance
1. Reduce scan scope (fewer ports, smaller wordlists)
2. Check Docker resource allocation
3. Try during off-peak hours
4. Ask Warp AI: "How can I optimize scan performance?"
```

#### Tip 5: Leverage Warp's Command Blocks

Warp groups commands in blocks. You can:
- Click any block to see its full output
